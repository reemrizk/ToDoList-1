       <h3>Katie O'Donnell</h3>
       <p>I'm currently finishing my last year of studying Computer Science at Wayne State University. Outside of school, I work part time as a bobarista at Tou & Mai. 
          I spend most of my free time reading, going for walks, and cooking. One fun fact about me is that I hate writing auto-bios, hence my lackluster tone in this one.</p>
        
       <h3>Reem Rizk</h3>
       <p>I'm graduating this winter with my degree in Computer Science at Wayne State University. 
            Some of my hobbies include strength-training, drawing, and spending time with my cat Fifo (she's a queue).
            After graduating, I hope to travel for a bit after securing a job. </p>
